Cracking the Coding Interview al la Go
====

As a form of practice I've taken my hand at solving the questions in "Cracking the Coding Interview" in the Go language.  This contradicts the book's advice of trying to solve the problems outside a text editor (to prepare for the whiteboarding).  This is primarily an exercise in learning the Go language alongside polishing my programming skills.

I've admittedly studied the book already, but haven't memorized the answers.  My goal is to work through the questions a chapter at a time.  Each chapter I will try to solve all of the questions without checking answers.  Then I will commit my solutions, check my answers and review (iterating if necessary), then move forwards a chapter at a time.
